# Operating System Kernel for RISC-V Processor

**Date:** August 2022  
**Technologies Used:** C/C++, Assembly, RISC-V Architecture  

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a basic operating system kernel for the RISC-V processor. The kernel is designed to implement essential operating system functionalities, ensuring efficient management of resources and system control. The implementation is done using C/C++ and Assembly, with a focus on low-level system operations on the RISC-V architecture.

## Features

- **Memory Allocation:** Efficient dynamic memory allocation system for managing resources.
- **Context Switching:** Implemented context switching for multitasking, allowing the processor to handle multiple tasks concurrently.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Developed interrupt routines for handling system calls, semaphore operations, and asynchronous context switching.
- **Key and Timer Interrupts:** Handled control when interrupts are triggered by keys or timers, enabling interaction with the system.
- **Semaphore Implementation:** Ensured synchronization of processes using semaphores to avoid race conditions.

## Languages and Technologies

- **C/C++:** Core logic and kernel functions.
- **Assembly:** Low-level processor operations and interrupt handling.
- **RISC-V Architecture:** A modern open-source processor architecture, tailored for educational and industrial applications.
